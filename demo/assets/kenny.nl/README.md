Included here are asset packs downloaded from kenney.nl. 

Most of these packs make assets available in multiple formats, I've removed those we don't use to save space in this repository.

You'll also find a subfolder called `Godot` in which I've placed Godot scenes that convert or augment assets as we need them in this demo project.
Materials saved in these folders may use textures from other asset libraries.

See license information in the subfolders for the license of each asset pack.
